r is just wierd. no easy way to read or write.
seems like you mist used read lines and write lines.

play3 seems to agree with java code for buy[0-2].

maybe read ystock00.csv and drive play 3.

some() in play3 gets:

[1] "JBK,   0.956,   0.149,   0.811"
Error in if (buy(i, prices)) { : missing value where TRUE/FALSE needed

so add try catch block from get.R to some() in symbols.

switched over to get0.R - more stable.

splitting up into 4 files:
    main, get0, strategy, and play3.

getting:     
Warning messages:

2: BRK.AX contains missing values. Some functions will not work if objects contain missing values in the middle of the series. Consider using na.omit(), na.approx(), na.fill(), etc to remove or replace them. 

try to rewrite some() in play3.R using code from get0.R

maybe changing get0 is easier. make it return a list of stuff or pass in a function and resturn? ....

need to make run() in play3,R  return a list of  lists.

getting HTTP error 429. rerun 00 and see if we are getting that. if we are, put in some sleeps.

checking for 429 and stopping now.
maybe count the types of errors.

strabge error near split 32:

1] "index: 174, symbol: NWFFF"
Error in if (buy(i, prices)) { : missing value where TRUE/FALSE needed

cut -d "," -f 1 file

gather.R which makes highest.csv.
highest.R which make a file like yahoosymbols.csv,
but just has those symbold with the highest backrolls.

we need to read ths with get0.R (or a new get.R),
and experiemnt with buying stretegies.

maybe read yahoo highest and:
    1) use get0 or something like it to make bankroll files.
    2) read the data for each stock and write it so java can read it.

reading yahho highest and getting symbols
get a lot of warnings (NA's). 
only aboy 300 out of the 2,000 in yahoo highest.

try with less data (was 1990 - present)

using last year seems to work fine. 
this is as expected since that was how we got this data

try a few more earlier years.

check for http 209 first else done<-TRUE

10/25/23 giving up on java for now due to reading .csv files.
10/27/23 got open csv to work fine in the java version

how di the stuff in /raz get in this firectory?

need a way to get the 404's in a set

made not429bads.csv
