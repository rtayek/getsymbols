r is just wierd. no easy way to read or write.
seems linme you mist used read lines and write lines.

play3 seems to agree with java code for buy[0-2].

maybe read ystock00.csv and drive play 3.

some() in play3 gets:

[1] "JBK,   0.956,   0.149,   0.811"
Error in if (buy(i, prices)) { : missing value where TRUE/FALSE needed

so add try catch block from get.R to some() in symbols.

switched over to get0.R - more stable.

splitting up into 4 files:
    main, get0, strategy, and play3.

getting:     
Warning messages:
1: BMH.AX contains missing values. Some functions will not work if objects contain missing values in the middle of the series. Consider using na.omit(), na.approx(), na.fill(), etc to remove or replace them. 
2: BRK.AX contains missing values. Some functions will not work if objects contain missing values in the middle of the series. Consider using na.omit(), na.approx(), na.fill(), etc to remove or replace them. 

try to rewrite some() in play3.R using code from get0.R

maybe changing get0 is easier. make it return a list of stuff or pass in a function and resturn? ....

need to make run() in play3,R  return a list of  lists.

getting HTTP error 429. rerun 00 and see if we are getting that. if we are, put in some sleeps.

checking for 429 and stopping now.
maybe count the types of errors.

strabge error near split 32:

1] "index: 174, symbol: NWFFF"
Error in if (buy(i, prices)) { : missing value where TRUE/FALSE needed
