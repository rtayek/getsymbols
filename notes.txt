r is just wierd. no easy way to read or write.
seems linme you mist used read lines and write lines.

play3 seems to agree with java code for buy[0-2].

maybe read ystock00.csv and drive play 3.

some() in play3 gets:

[1] "JBK,   0.956,   0.149,   0.811"
Error in if (buy(i, prices)) { : missing value where TRUE/FALSE needed

so add try catch block from get.R to some() in symbols.

switched over to get0.R - more stable.

splitting up into 4 files:
    main, get0, strategy, and play3.
